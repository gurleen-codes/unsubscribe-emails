- üîß **New:** Improved dashboard with visual subscription management
- üõ†Ô∏è **New:** Fixed functionality for unsubscribe buttons
- üì¶ **New:** Better session management for large data sets

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A valid email account (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud, AOL, etc.)
- Some providers require an **App Password** (Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, AOL)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-unsubscriber.git
cd email-unsubscriber
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation Notes

### Basic vs. Full Installation

The application can be installed in two modes:

**Basic Installation:** The core functionality will work with just the basic dependencies in requirements.txt.

**Full Installation:** For enhanced features like ML-based categorization and advanced analytics, additional libraries are needed.

If you encounter issues installing scikit-learn or other ML libraries (especially on macOS or newer Python versions), you can still use the application with reduced functionality:

```bash
# Install core dependencies first
pip install flask beautifulsoup4 requests python-dotenv oauthlib flask-session

# Then optionally try to install ML dependencies
pip install pandas numpy
pip install scikit-learn
```

The application will automatically detect which libraries are available and adjust its features accordingly:

**When scikit-learn is not available:**
- The application will use simple keyword-based categorization instead of ML-based categorization
- Categories will still be assigned, but without confidence scores

**When pandas is not available:**
- The application will provide simplified analytics without trend analysis
- Basic subscription counts and time-saving estimates will still be available

This ensures that core unsubscription functionality works regardless of which libraries are installed.

## Email Provider Setup

Depending on your email provider, you may need to enable IMAP access and generate an **App Password**:

- **Gmail**: Go to your [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/) ‚Üí App Passwords.
- **Yahoo**: Visit [Yahoo Account Security](https://login.yahoo.com/account/security) ‚Üí Generate App Password.
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: Go to [Microsoft Account Security](https://account.live.com/proofs/AppPassword) ‚Üí Create App Password.
- **iCloud**: Visit [Apple ID Security](https://appleid.apple.com/) ‚Üí Generate App Password.
- **AOL**: Enable App Passwords in [AOL Account Security](https://login.aol.com/account/security).

If your email provider is not listed, you can **manually set the IMAP server**:
```python
unsubscriber = EmailUnsubscriber("user@custommail.com", "password")
unsubscriber.set_custom_imap("imap.custommail.com", 993)
```

## Usage

1. Start the web interface:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5002
```
**Note:** The server now runs on port 5002 by default.

3. Enter your email address, select your provider, and enter the App Password.
4. Click **Scan Emails** to start scanning for newsletters.
5. You'll be redirected to the dashboard where you can manage and unsubscribe from your subscriptions.

## **Dashboard Features**

The tool includes a comprehensive **interactive dashboard** that provides a user-friendly way to manage your subscriptions.

### **How to Use the Dashboard**

1. After scanning, the dashboard displays:
   - **Total subscriptions found**
   - **Categories of subscriptions**
   - **Successfully unsubscribed emails**
   - **Subscription statistics**

2. You can select multiple emails and use the bulk unsubscribe feature to remove them from mailing lists.

3. The dashboard provides visual feedback when unsubscribing:
   - Loading indicators during processing
   - Success/failure status messages
   - Updated count of unsubscribed emails

4. The dashboard dynamically updates as new emails are scanned or unsubscribed.

5. View categorized statistics to understand your email subscription patterns.

## Advanced Features

### Subscription Analytics

The application includes an advanced analytics system to provide insights about your email subscriptions:

- Category distribution of newsletters
- Time trends showing when you received the most promotional emails
- Identification of potential spam sources
- Recommendations for which subscriptions to prioritize removing
- Estimated time saved by unsubscribing

### Session Management

For users with many subscriptions, the application now includes improved session management:

- Sessions are stored in a filesystem instead of cookies to handle large amounts of data
- Session data is securely managed and automatically cleaned up
- Performance optimizations for large inbox scanning

## API Documentation

### EmailUnsubscriber Class

#### Initialization
```python
unsubscriber = EmailUnsubscriber(email_address: str, app_password: str)
```
- `email_address`: Valid email address
- `app_password`: App Password from the provider (if required)

#### Methods

1. `connect_to_email() -> imaplib.IMAP4_SSL`
```python
def connect_to_email(self) -> imaplib.IMAP4_SSL:
    """
    Establishes connection to the email provider's IMAP server
    Returns:
        IMAP4_SSL: Connected mail object
    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If connection or authentication fails
    """
```

2. `find_unsubscribe_links(num_emails: int = 50) -> List[Dict]`
```python
def find_unsubscribe_links(self, num_emails: int = 50) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Scans inbox for newsletter subscriptions
    """
```

3. `get_subscription_stats() -> Dict`
```python
def get_subscription_stats(self) -> Dict:
    """
    Retrieves statistics about newsletter subscriptions
    """
```

4. `unsubscribe(link: str) -> bool`
```python
def unsubscribe(self, link: str) -> bool:
    """
    Attempts to unsubscribe using provided link
    """
```

## Security Notes

- Never share your App Password
- The tool stores credentials only in session memory
- The web interface is for development use only; additional security measures are needed for production
- Session data is now stored in the filesystem rather than cookies for better security and performance

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå `TypeError: bad operand type for unary -: 'str'`
‚úÖ **Fix:** Ensure `num_emails` is an integer in both frontend and backend.

### ‚ùå `500 Internal Server Error`
‚úÖ **Fix:** Check Flask logs (`flask run --debug`) for the exact error.

### ‚ùå `200 OK but "An error occurred" in UI`
‚úÖ **Fix:** The backend response format has changed. Ensure `data.data` is checked instead of `data.status`.

### ‚ùå `"Failed to load resource: 404 NOT FOUND"`
‚úÖ **Fix:** Ensure static assets (SVG files) are inside `static/images/` and referenced correctly.

### ‚ùå `SubscriptionAnalytics` object has no attribute errors
‚úÖ **Fix:** Make sure the indentation in the `subscription_analytics.py` file is correct. All methods should be properly indented under the class.

### ‚ùå Cookie size warning
‚úÖ **Fix:** The application now uses filesystem sessions instead of cookies to handle large amounts of data.
